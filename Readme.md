# Calorie Burn Estimation System

### Overview

This project involves the evaluation and comparison of various regression models to predict a target variable based on provided features. The project utilizes several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor. The performance of these models is assessed using different metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* xgboost

```markdown
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

### Data Description

* **Calories Dataset:** Contains data related to calories burned during exercise.
* **Exercise Dataset:** Contains data on various exercises performed by individuals.

### Project Structure

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
  * The datasets are loaded using pandas.
  * The data is inspected for missing values, which are then handled appropriately.
  * Descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques are used to understand the distribution of features.
* **Model Training:**
  * The data is split into training and testing sets.
  * Various regression models are trained on the training data.
* **Model Evaluation:**
  * The models are evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² on both evaluation and test datasets.
  * The results are used to compare the models and identify the best-performing model.

### How to Run

1. Load the Data: Ensure that the data files are in the correct path as specified in the code.
2. Execute the Code: Run the notebook cells sequentially. The code will preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate them.
3. View Results: The evaluation metrics for each model will be displayed, allowing you to compare their performance.

### Conclusion

The project concludes with a comparison of the regression models. Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest Regressor is identified as the best model for this particular dataset, due to its superior performance in terms of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².

### Notes

* This project focuses on evaluating models using several key metrics. While R² is useful for understanding the goodness of fit, MAE, MSE, and RMSE are more directly related to prediction accuracy.
* The data and models used are for demonstration purposes, and the approach may need to be adjusted based on specific project requirements or datasets.
